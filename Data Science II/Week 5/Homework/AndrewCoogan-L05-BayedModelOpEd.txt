I took a look at the article that was posted in the LinkedIn group about the search for Air France Flight 447 (https://www.informs.org/ORMS-Today/Public-Articles/August-Volume-38-Number-4/In-Search-of-Air-France-Flight-447).  Air France flight 447 took off from Rio de Janeiro and was heading towards Paris when it disappeared over the South Atlantic in stormy weather.  About a year after the disappearance, Metron was given the monolith task of finding the plane.  The only starting place Metron had was the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting Systems (ACARS).  It sends a signal out at fixed time intervals (ten minutes), so they had last position reported from ACARS and vector.  The BEA postulated that the flight went down within forty nautical miles (NM) of the last known location from the ACARS.  The first search as a passive sonar search looking for the blackboxes.  The second search was a side-looking sonar search by the pourpuoi pas?.  Phase three was searches using radar and manual processes.  After the failure of these three phases, Metron was brought in to find the wreckage.  Using all of the data gathered in the first three phases, Metron produced a posterior probability distribution (PDF) that can be best described as a heatmap that shows the highest likely for the location of the downed aircraft.  Some of the additional parameters used was the location and timestamp of bodies and parts found in conjunction with leeway (current and wind patterns).  Later on in the simulations, Metron had to assume that the phase one data was faulty.  Once this was established, models started towards pointing towards an area that was right around the last reported location by ACARS.  Upon researching the most likely area, the wreck was located within one week using the data provided by Metron.
